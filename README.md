# microPAM
 
 This repository contains the source code for the microPAM project that can be found at https://www.micropam.com 
 
 There are two versions
## microPAM_T4
This is a Teensy T4.1 only version that uses Teensy specific code. In particular it contains USB-Audio interface to PC.

This code is for quick testing of Teensy systems. Consider to use the microPAM_V2 version.

## microPAM_V2
This version contains code that runs both on RP2040 and Teensy T4.1 based systems. So far, it does not contain USB-Audio interface to PC.

However, this is the prefered code as it is in active development

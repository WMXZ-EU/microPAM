 The menu is minimized to start/end acquisition, correct external RTC and to print actual acquisition parameters. It is expected that the user adapts the acquisition parameters in config.h and recompiles the program.

## Menu
 The menu commands are 
 - s: start acquisition
 - e: end acquisition
 - c: check and change RTC
 - p: print system and acquisition parameters 
 
 ## Configuration
 The program configuration is controlled by config.h

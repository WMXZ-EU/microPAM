# microPAM_V2
 
 This directory contains the source code for both the Teensy T4.1 and the KB2040/RP2040 based microPAM project that can be found at https://www.micropam.com .
 
 The kb2040/rp2040 code uses both cores with the acquisition running on the second core. This is to ensure that optional data compression has time to run.
